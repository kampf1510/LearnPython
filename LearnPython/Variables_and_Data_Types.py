# Variables and Data Types

# To define a variable simply type the variables name then assign a value to it, such as x = 1 in this case x would
# be the variable and 1 is the value of the variable.

# The value of x = 1 is an INT or Integer, any whole number WITHOUT a decimal is counted as an INT

x = 1

# Code is executed line by line meaning you can define a variable a different value later in your code,
# in this example x = 1 on line 7 But is given the value of 9 on line 12

x = 9

# The value of y = 1.1 is a FLOAT, a FLOAT value includes a decimal such as 55.34.

y = 1.1

# The value "Hello World" is a STRING, when defining a STRING in a variable you must enclose it with quotes such as
# "String".

t = "Hello World"

# The value of b = True is a BOOL, short for boolean the value of this datatype may be True or False.

b = True

# If you're unsure of the datatype of a variable you can display it to the console by running the below command,
# replacing the x for the name of the variable. To add a line of code which will not run, comment it out by typing #
# before the lines code, practice commenting out the code below then run it.

print(type(x))

# To output a variable's value to the terminal use the print statement, in the example below we assigned the variable
# t = "Hello World" thus printing the t variable will output the value of t to the user.

print(t)

# Practice creating a variable named data and assign the value Python Pro to it then output the value of data to the
# terminal Then ONLY output the datatype of the variable data to the terminal.

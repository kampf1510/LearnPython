# Python Algorithms

# An algorithm is best described as a set of instructions or rules expressed in a step-by-step fashion that
# represents the procedure to solve the problem to reach the required to be output is called an Algorithm - the best
# analogy is a recipe. Algorithms are analyzed and ranked on their efficiency using the big O notation.

# Below is an example of an algorithm to add two numbers together, this algorithm serves an incredibly specific and
# tailored role in the code - to add two numbers together, and it's quite good at the task.

def add_numbers():
    input1 = input("Enter the first number: ")
    input2 = input("Enter the second number: ")
    print(int(input1) + int(input2))


add_numbers()

# As you can imagine, algorithms are a fundamental piece of programming as they're used to solve problems given a set
# of instructions, simply put - an algorithm should be designed to solve a specific problem in the code efficiently.
# I highly recommend you read deeper into the resources I link on the wiki as this is a very valuable topic.

# Create your first algorithm to take a user's input then multiply the numbers together and print it to the screen,
# you may use the above add_numbers algorithm as an example.
